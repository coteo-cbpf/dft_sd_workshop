# dft_sd_workshop
Hands-on spin-dynamics workshop: build an atomistic LLG solver in Python from scratch. Step-by-step routines cover lattices, J/D interactions, neighbor lists, effective fields, integration, and interactive visualization. Examples include chain, 20×20 square skyrmion (PBC + Zeeman), and Kagomé non-collinear order.
